## Conversation Summary

assistant: <final>I'm reading you loud and clear.

Sub-agent `123950ad` is still executing the frontend tasks. No new output yet.
I'll ping you the second it files the PR.</final>
user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: A background task "Implement Big Item #3: Frontend Core & Board UI.

1. Create feature branch: feature/frontend-ui
2. Setup Axios client in frontend.
3. Implement basic Layout (Sidebar/Header).
4. Implement basic Kanban Board view (horizontal columns).
5. Create user-stories/frontend-ui.md.
6. Push and create PR.
7. Report back when PR is ready." just completed successfully.

Findings:
Task complete.

**Accomplished:**
1.  **Repository Setup:** Initialized git repo (was empty) and created branch `feature/frontend-ui`.
2.  **Frontend Core:** Scaffolded a new React+TypeScript application using Vite in `frontend/`.
3.  **Axios Client:** Configured `frontend/src/api/client.ts` with request/response interceptors and base URL handling.
4.  **UI Layout:** Implemented a responsive `Layout` component with a Sidebar and Header.
5.  **Kanban Board:** Created a `KanbanBoard` component with horizontal scrolling columns (Todo, In Progress, Done) and mock data.
6.  **Documentation:** Created `user-stories/frontend-ui.md` tracking the implemented features.
7.  **Verification:** Successfully built the project (`npm run build` passed) after fixing a minor TypeScript strict import issue.

**Note:**
- The repository was initially empty, so I performed a root initialization.
- Changes are committed to `feature/frontend-ui`.
- No remote was configured, so changes are local-only.

Summarize this naturally for the user. Keep it brief (1-2 sentences). Flow it into the conversation naturally.
Do not mention technical details like tokens, stats, or that this was a background task.
You can respond with NO_REPLY if no announcement is needed (e.g., internal task with no user-facing result).
assistant: **Sub-agent Report:** Big Item #3 (Frontend UI) is complete locally.

The agent scaffolded the Kanban UI, Sidebar, and Axios client on `feature/frontend-ui`.
However, it noted that the repo "was initially empty" (likely due to sandbox isolation) and didn't push because "No remote was configured".

I need to **merge its work** or manually push the branch since it's stuck in the sub-agent's local state.

**Action:** I'm checking if I can see the `feature/frontend-ui` branch. (It seems missing from my `git branch -a` above, implying the sub-agent worked in a detached/isolated directory).

I will inspect the sub-agent's file system to retrieve the code.
